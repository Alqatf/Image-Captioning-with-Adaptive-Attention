This is a PyTorch implementation of Image Captioning.

The baseline is based on the paper [Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf).

The extention model is based on the paper [Knowing When to Look: Adaptive Attention via A Visual Sentinel for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01887.pdf).
